The goal of this project is to use Machine Learning in Python to build a Multiple Disease Prediction System. We will also use Streamlit to deploy this web app. The web app uses machine learning to predict diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's. I created and trained the model using classification algorithms which are SVM for Diabetes and Parkinson's prediction and Logistic Regression for Heart disease. Further, I exported these three models and created a web application that uses Streamlit to predict all three categories of diseases by providing input values that were used to train the models.
